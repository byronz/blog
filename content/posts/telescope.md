I was interested to buy my first telescope, and here are my criteria:

* portable - I need to transport it to dark site and don't want to spend 1 hour setup everything in the cold dark
* planertry vs deep dark - this is hard to tell, see moon or saturn will be excited for the first time, but what about the next
* budget - 200$ - 500$

## Reflector

Designed by *Issac Newton* in 18xx to solve one common problem in refractor.

> **NOTE**
>   Keep in mind that you need to calibrate the mirrors from time to time
